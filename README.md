# Human-object interaction
Design and realization of a neural system to detect and recognize human-object interaction

In this work a neural-network based interaction detector is proposed. On the basis of the signals coming from two pairs of accelerometers and gyroscopes (placed, respectively, on the userâ€™s wrist and inside a backpack) an interaction detection with a high precision can be performed. Results have shown that, with the proper choice of features, it is possible to detect an interaction with an accuracy of roughly 99%.
